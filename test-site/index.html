    <h1>Merry (Almost) Christmas!</h1>

      <p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go.
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again,
with candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Toys in every store.
But the prettiest sight to see, is the holly that will be
On your own front door.
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
is the wish of Barney and Ben.
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
is the hope of Janice and Jen.
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
everywhere you go.
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
soon the bells will start.
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.</p>
